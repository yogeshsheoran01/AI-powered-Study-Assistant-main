- 📄 Summarizing notes or uploaded PDFs  
- ❓ Generating quizzes, solving exam questions, and evaluating answers

Combines **Streamlit** for UI and **Gemini 2.5 Flash API** for fast, intelligent AI responses — all in a clean chat-based interface.

### 2️⃣ Mode Usage

  SGPA returns a simple, exam-oriented explanation, plus an idea for a quick diagram you can sketch.

- **Summarizer**:  
  Upload a PDF or paste notes.  
  SGPA returns an exam-ready summary with headings, bullets, and practice questions.

### 3️⃣ Tips for Best Results

- Use follow-up prompts in the same chat to refine or extend answers.  
- Reset the chat using the “New Chat” / reset option before switching topics heavily.
