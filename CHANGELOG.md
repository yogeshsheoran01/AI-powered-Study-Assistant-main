# 🧾 CHANGELOG
**Project:** Study Guide & Personal Assistant  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/GPA95/SGPA](https://github.com/yogeshsheoran01/AI-powered-Study-Assistant-main.git)
  
**Last Updated:** 1st February 2026

### 🆕 Version 1.2.0 — Visual + Analytics + UI Refresh (January 2026)

#### ✨ New Features & Improvements

- **Visual Explanations in Explainer**
  - Explainer responses now include a simple, sketchable diagram idea at the end of each explanation.
  - Diagrams are described in text so students can quickly draw them in notebooks during revision or exams.

- **Summarizer PDF Handling Fixes**
  - Added a stronger “short text” guard for PDF summarization.
  - Clear warning message when extracted text is too short or likely from scanned/image-based PDFs, guiding users to try another file or paste text directly.
  - Reduces confusing “too short to summarize” loops and improves robustness with real-world PDFs.

- **Lightweight Usage Analytics**
  - Implemented privacy-friendly interaction logging to a local CSV file.
  - Each interaction logs timestamp, anonymous session ID, mode (Explainer / Summarizer / Quizzer), sub-mode, PDF usage flag, and prompt/response length.
  - Enables post-hoc analysis of:
    - Total interactions
    - Approximate study sessions
    - Mode usage distribution
    - PDF-based study patterns

- **Branding & UI Updates**
  - Rebranded app in UI to **SGPA – Study Guide & Personal Assistant**.
  - Added a custom SGPA logo and integrated it into the app header/page icon.
  - Introduced a custom Streamlit theme (e.g., “Focus Forest” / “Modern Academic”) via `.streamlit/config.toml` for a more polished, student-friendly look.

#### 🛠️ Internal & Maintenance

- Ensured logging is fail-safe (analytics never breaks the app if file writes fail).
- Normalized asset paths and filenames for reliable deployment on Streamlit Cloud.
- Cleaned up `.gitignore` and configuration files so theme and analytics behave consistently in both local and cloud environments.

### Version 1.1.0 — Major Feature Update (November 2025)
