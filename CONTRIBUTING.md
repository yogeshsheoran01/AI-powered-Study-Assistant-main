## ✅ Pull request expectations

To keep the project maintainable:

- Keep PRs focused and small (one logical change per PR).  
- Make sure the app runs without errors on your branch.  
- Be responsive to review comments and open to changes.  
- Do not include:
- Secrets, API keys, or credentials  
- Large, unrelated refactors mixed with feature changes

PRs that do not meet these basics may be closed.
